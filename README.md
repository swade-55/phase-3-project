Phase3-Final-Project

Sam's Asset Management System

Overview Sam's Asset Management is a tool a warehouse manager uses to upload a roster of equipment. This equipment will be housed in lockers. The manager will have visibility to metrics such as inventory count per locker by accessing option three on the menu bar of the command line interface(CLI). Additionally, the manager can perform check-in/check-out operations by utilizing options 1 and 2 on the CLI. These activities will update the locker inventory(option 3) in real-time.

Instructions:

This CLI app can run locally on your computer. Note that you must cd into the lib directory before running the command. Run the following command in your terminal:

python cli.py
